Irrespective of the B or I prefixes, the slot types capture the entity and its role in the utterance. The slot-type labeling for our method is obtained by initializing vectors of the length of the utterance. Since there are three slot types, as shown in Figure 2, there are three one-hot vectors; (a) Origin slot type, (b) 'Destination' slot type, and (c) Offset. Three such additional vectors are fed into binary classifiers for each utterance to obtain slot-type attention weights and features.
