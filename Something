Irrespective of B or I prefix, the slot types captures the entity and its role in the utterance. The slot-type labeling for our method is obtained by initializing vectors of the length of the utterance. Since there are three slot types, as shown in Figure 2, there are three one-hot vectors; (a) Origin slot type, (b) 'Destination' slot type, and (c) Offset. For each utterance, there are three such additional vectors which are fed into binary classifiers to obtain slot-type attention weights and features.
